While the VAT imposed in each country varies, in general as a tax on expenditure, the burden of VAT is intended to fall just on consumers. However, it is paid on all transactions by all VAT-registered firms, so how can this be? The way it works is that the firm pays VAT on all the goods and materials it buys and it also charges VAT on all the goods it sells. At the end of each month or quarter, the firm then works out all the VAT it has paid out to its suppliers and all the VAT it has received from its customers.","parent_uuid":"e050226b-b9cf-4f73-892d-32327e83900b","odp_last_updated":"2007-04-16T11:16:39-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":271858},{"uuid":"335b7613-8fd7-494d-8beb-95ab910e1069","title":"Aerospace_and_Defense","translations":{"spa":"Militar","swe":"Flyg och f\u00f6rsvarsindustri","ita":"Aerospaziale e Militare","eng":"Aerospace_and_Defense","jpn":"\u822a\u7a7a\u5b87\u5b99\u30fb\u9632\u885b","zho":"\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u4e0e\u9632\u536b","nor":"Fly- og forsvarsindustri","rus":"\u0410\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f, \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435","pol":"Technika wojskowa","fra":"A\u00e9rospatiale et d\u00e9fense","deu":"Verteidigung, Luft- und Raumfahrt","ces":"Letectv\u00ed a vojsko","ukr":"\u0410\u0432\u0456\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f \u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430"},"description":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Aerospace and Defense\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; category comprises industries and establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the following:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Development, manufacture, and distribution of civil and military aircraft, missiles, space vehicles, military equipment, and the auxiliary equipment, parts and supplies.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Development, manufacture, and distribution of aerospace engines, propulsion units, and auxiliary equipment or parts.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; Development and production of aerospace and military product prototypes. \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; Aircraft conversion (i.e., major modifications to systems). \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; Complete aircraft or propulsion systems overhaul and rebuilding (i.e., periodic restoration of aircraft to original design specifications).\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Services that specifically support these industries (e.g., consulting, marketing, associations, etc.).\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In general, the aerospace industry is engaged in the research, development, and manufacture of flight vehicles, ranging from unpowered gliders, sailplanes and lighter-than-air craft up though space vehicles.

This family includes the Old World camelids; the Dromedary camel, Camelus dromedarius, and the Bactrian camel, Camelus bactrianus, and the South American Camelids (SACs), the Llama, Lama glama, alpaca, Lama pacos, guanaco, Lama guanicoe and the vicuna, Vicugna vicugna. All of the SACs can produce fertile crosses and indeed the alpaca and llama are run so closely together that cross breeding is a very common occurrence and at one time threatened the true line of species. Although Camelids have a complex three part stomach, they are in fact not ruminants as the digestive system is slightly different, they do not have horns or antlers and instead of a cloven hoof, they have callous pads ending in two claws. Camelids have been described in the suborder Tylopoda, meaning pad-footed, in the Order Artiodactyla. Alpacas and Llamas exist only as domestic species whereas the guanaco and vicuna are wild. Guanaco can be found at altitudes ranging from sea level in Tierra del Fuego to 4000 metres along the Andes of northern Chile, Peru and Argentina. The environments that they inhabit range from the Atacama desert, one of the driest in the world to snow capped, wind swept peaks, glaciers and even forests. Guanaco have to cope with bleak winters, driving snow, freezing temperatures, fierce winds and a generally poor vegetation. There are areas of lush bog areas known as bofadels which are prized territories for breeding males. Guanaco are both grazers and browsers able to take opportunity of any potential food source. Guanaco are found in relatively small numbers outside of South America, mainly in the USA, Europe and Australia. Zoos and wildlife parks are the main locations but growing numbers of people are keeping them on small holdings, either as tourist attractions, as pets or as hobby fibre producers. A minority keep them as 'farm' animals such as here at Esgyrn. They have excellent digestive systems that enables them to graze on marginal land that other livestock won't accept and they also mix well with other livestock.","parent_uuid":"573e1d12-051e-4f54-80d6-6e6394f09a82","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:47:24-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":276934},{"uuid":"7d35a30f-f6cc-4270-81ee-eb2ef2d73a64","title":"Llamas","translations":{"eng":"Llamas","dan":"Lamaer","deu":"Lama"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"573e1d12-051e-4f54-80d6-6e6394f09a82","odp_last_updated":"2008-11-09T06:10:09-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":276935},{"uuid":"384613d4-1fa7-4b91-b23e-f5a321e6a7be","title":"Associations","translations":{"eng":"Associations"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"7d35a30f-f6cc-4270-81ee-eb2ef2d73a64","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:47:21-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":276940},{"uuid":"24d99537-b458-451d-a3f5-85fea3003eb7","title":"Breeders","translations":{"eng":"Breeders"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"7d35a30f-f6cc-4270-81ee-eb2ef2d73a64","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:47:21-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":276937},{"uuid":"9ffd5e4b-9430-4102-af49-654a1d2223d2","title":"Hiking_and_Packing","translations":{"eng":"Hiking_and_Packing"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"7d35a30f-f6cc-4270-81ee-eb2ef2d73a64","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:47:21-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":276939},{"uuid":"b0fb1517-6c7d-4c81-afc6-57e03b4635bf","title":"News_and_Media","translations":{"eng":"News_and_Media"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"7d35a30f-f6cc-4270-81ee-eb2ef2d73a64","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:47:21-05:00","related":["31074735-dafd-4847-a0f1-bdbec54abe7e"],"odp_id":276936},{"uuid":"d060bd77-05e2-4446-a3aa-c0bb53252d47","title":"Supplies_and_Equipment","translations":{"eng":"Supplies_and_Equipment"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"7d35a30f-f6cc-4270-81ee-eb2ef2d73a64","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:47:21-05:00","related":["b8a34b0c-480e-4cf1-b046-227e6b28761c"],"odp_id":276938},{"uuid":"25b75d14-91d1-49e9-a3c8-6ec0157abd33","title":"Cattle","translations":{"nld":"Runderen","eng":"Cattle","zho":"\u755c\u7267\u4e1a","deu":"Rinder"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"a5bd06c3-c319-46f9-b3ea-124d0c07ae9e","odp_last_updated":"2010-01-31T09:54:18-05:00","related":["4be2ccd9-90e8-4b85-8268-b18966d20386"],"odp_id":276663},{"uuid":"a9b46944-cba9-4299-a2cb-da79a0ad5637","title":"Beef","translations":{"eng":"Beef","deu":"Fleischrinder"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"25b75d14-91d1-49e9-a3c8-6ec0157abd33","odp_last_updated":"2008-11-09T05:32:32-05:00","related":["d9f25a82-6bd0-4054-b22f-fa28ac0ac19a"],"odp_id":276664},{"uuid":"117023d3-9f07-4273-9a8c-b5c1b6d0e89e","title":"Associations","translations":{"eng":"Associations","deu":"Organisationen"},"description":"Nonspecific

Organizations of all types use consultants, and these consultants examine these organizations from a broad operational perspective applying a variety of skills to achieve a specific outcome, solution, or result.

Consultants have many roles, varying from a supportive one within an existing team, to providing temporary leadership over an identified problem area, to other independent activities conducted at the request of the organization. This category has been divided into three areas to reflect the many functions and roles within the business consulting profession. The top level is divided by some of the various specialty or focus areas typical to the business consulting industry (e.g., business formation, financial, management, manufacturing, outsourcing, etc.).

In some cases syntactic foam also offers radar or sonar transparency. Syntactic foam is used for buoyancy modules in marine drilling risers, in deep ocean submersibles, boat hulls and components in aircraft.

Straw bales are traditionally a waste product which farmers do not till under the soil, but do sell as animal bedding or landscape supply due to their durable nature. In many areas, it is also burned, causing severe air quality problems. Straw is the dry plant material or stalk left in the field after a plant has matured, been harvested for seed, and is no longer alive. Hay bales are made from short species of livestock feed grass that is green/alive and are not suitable for this application. Hay is also typically twice the price of straw.","parent_uuid":"48a07483-bb35-404e-a2f4-d00920ea6153","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:47:50-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":272518},{"uuid":"a3bbfca6-037d-4500-ad55-3ae0308e37ea","title":"Thatched","translations":{"eng":"Thatched"},"description":"Barns","parent_uuid":"48a07483-bb35-404e-a2f4-d00920ea6153","odp_last_updated":"2007-09-27T21:18:49-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":272521},{"uuid":"e9b92dda-c635-4414-ab99-a327066f1d61","title":"Yurts","translations":{"eng":"Yurts"},"description":"Yurts are portable dwellings that orginated over 2500 years ago in Mongolia.

Stamping concrete is an art and a science thus requiring advanced concrete placement skills as well as proper tools and materials.The process involves applying texture and color to cast-in-place concrete using various methods and tools. The most common method is to \"stamp\" the pattern ortexture into the concrete when it is still in a semi-plastic state by using \"concrete stamps\". These stamps are either rigid (similar to a cookie cutter that creates a pattern only) or are in the form of a \"stamp mat\",(usually made of rubber or hard plastic) that is used to create a pattern and texture. The stamps are usually applied to concrete that has been colored in various ways to help the craftsman achieve the overall effect. The coloring is often enhance or antiqued during the stamping process by the addition of secondary coloring. This created the authentic look of real stone, brick, textured tile, or granite. Stamped concrete has all of the durability and longevity of standard concrete and is often more durable due to the hardening additives that are commonly used in the coloring process and the addition of high grade concrete sealers.","parent_uuid":"71becd6c-2bf3-48c0-8fc6-674589f8ae71","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:48:08-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":272183},{"uuid":"c63aca71-678d-4b1e-8c1d-d88957c9c64f","title":"Forms_and_Accessories","translations":{"eng":"Forms_and_Accessories","deu":"Schalung und Zubeh\u00f6r"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"44379346-4167-4c75-9d46-3b4aab9a8c37","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:48:08-05:00","related":["b040061b-dae5-422a-ab42-e2f85375f2e0"],"odp_id":272181},{"uuid":"be442fb8-a980-4589-94ca-039f3377f047","title":"Precast","translations":{"eng":"Precast","deu":"Bauteile und Halbfabrikate"},"description":"Precast concrete is manufactured from stone, sand and cement to form a variety of construction materials.

category contains manufacturers and distributors of PVC and Fiberglass windows. Other types of polymer based windows may also be listed here. If you are looking for thermally efficient windows, and can accept limited color offerings, vinyl windows are a good choice. Some manufacturers now offer co-extruded and painted vinyl windows with more color options. Some brands have wood grain foils available for a wood look interior. Fiberglass windows are not extruded the way vinyl and aluminum windows are, but\"pultruded\" through heated dies. This process is slow and expensive, but the technology is improving and the number of manufacturers producing fiberglass windows is increasing, so prices may begin to come down. Fiberglass is stronger than vinyl, making them well suited for commercial construction and homes with larger openings. Some benefits of plastic windows are: 1. They have approximately the same insulating value as wood. 2. They do not warp or rot. 3. They can be expected to perform consistently well throughout their lifespan. 4. Many vinyl windows employ welded seams, making them tighter and less likely to leak. Some drawbacks of plastic windows are: 1. Vinyl window colors are often limited (usually, white is all that's available) 2. Painting vinyl windows is difficult, if not impossible, to do by the average homeowner. 3. Fiberglass windows are expensive. 4. Fiberglass cannot be welded (at least not with current technology).","parent_uuid":"72cbcc9d-7202-49b0-b4f1-92e7692428ca","odp_last_updated":"2009-04-27T14:30:57-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":272305},{"uuid":"071f7f61-c0e3-4fc2-8a8e-22537c2bcb37","title":"Replacements","translations":{"eng":"Replacements"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"72cbcc9d-7202-49b0-b4f1-92e7692428ca","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:48:05-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":272311},{"uuid":"a34edfb5-ccfc-4f77-a964-3613de93f91e","title":"Sealants_and_Weather-Stripping","translations":{"eng":"Sealants_and_Weather-Stripping"},"description":"Products designed to protect the inside of buildings and other structures against water infiltration and thermal loss or gain.","parent_uuid":"72cbcc9d-7202-49b0-b4f1-92e7692428ca","odp_last_updated":"2007-08-31T07:45:38-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":272326},{"uuid":"914a0f5e-57bd-40bb-b19c-8cf87bae2114","title":"Security","translations":{"ita":"Di Sicurezza","eng":"Security","deu":"Sicherheits- und Automatikt\u00fcren"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"72cbcc9d-7202-49b0-b4f1-92e7692428ca","odp_last_updated":"2010-04-14T06:19:21-05:00","related":["6f43433a-c2c7-4681-bcdf-7a2dec1951a8"],"odp_id":272299},{"uuid":"2ff71eb0-f3a1-49b7-b6a9-0fe07d9acc72","title":"Skylights","translations":{"eng":"Skylights"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"72cbcc9d-7202-49b0-b4f1-92e7692428ca","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:48:05-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":272315},{"uuid":"5347ae16-f57d-4a15-b931-72e6fc471ca7","title":"Specialty","translations":{"eng":"Specialty"},"description":"This category is for sites related to specialty doors and windows.","parent_uuid":"72cbcc9d-7202-49b0-b4f1-92e7692428ca","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:48:06-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":272300},{"uuid":"d6322278-4e19-496c-bffe-2c1c49545cec","title":"Doors","translations":{"eng":"Doors"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"5347ae16-f57d-4a15-b931-72e6fc471ca7","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:48:06-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":272301},{"uuid":"84cbeea4-eb98-4cea-980d-f7623601b5c7","title":"Air_Curtains","translations":{"eng":"Air_Curtains"},"description":"This category is for manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of loading dock equipment .

Trenchless technology is a diversified industry primarily within the construction and engineering industries, but with considerable ties to academic institutions (including multiple academic centers dedicated to trenchless technology), and with its own professional societies, trade magazines, website portals, etc. The trenchless technology industry uses various technologies to limit the disturbance of surface structures during the new installation or the repair of existing underground structures. In addition to being less disruptive, trenchless technologies are often faster and more cost-effective than the traditional direct burial construction techniques. Trenchless technologies such as horizontal directional drilling (hdd), microtunneling, pipe jacking, etc. are routinely used for the new installation of utility piping for the sewer, water, gas, power, cable, and telecommunications industries. Trenchless technologies such as grouting, coating, pipelining, pipe bursting, etc. are routinely used for the repair or replacement of such existing underground utilities, often as part of a regular operations and maintenance program.","parent_uuid":"e87bd2a5-4824-4e8c-a41c-62c532b8aee9","odp_last_updated":"2008-12-25T05:48:56-05:00","related":["9a5f2899-ee74-45d0-a9d7-6d01ec449d00","cf8a1713-ed1a-4ca1-a730-876b093ef34b","7c2f2170-d836-41d0-9e34-efbf6d5f6009"],"odp_id":272597},{"uuid":"349b30ef-0fcc-4afc-b4f3-24dadd5125c0","title":"Associations","translations":{"eng":"Associations"},"description":"There are several professional societies or trade organizations which are directly concerned with the trenchless technology industry.

True team building focuses on using the training approach to strengthen, build and increase team performance.","parent_uuid":"c258c3d1-c66a-4b13-89f9-fac0755ff659","odp_last_updated":"2007-09-27T23:27:23-05:00","related":["eafb42fe-04c6-4a64-a48c-de9654f8ab63"],"odp_id":278706},{"uuid":"ae5254eb-2fb9-43cf-86ad-eb5ef05b95bf","title":"Technology","translations":{"eng":"Technology"},"description":"Listings for those looking for training and education in technology.","parent_uuid":"c258c3d1-c66a-4b13-89f9-fac0755ff659","odp_last_updated":"2007-04-13T17:25:43-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":278701},{"uuid":"ed9e09a6-65a5-4c2d-91af-7247b752aef1","title":"Electronics_and_Electrical","translations":{"spa":"El\u00e9ctrica y electr\u00f3nica","swe":"Elektronik och elektricitet","ron":"Electronic\u0103 \u015fi electrotehnic\u0103","tur":"Elektrik ve Elektronik","cat":"El\u00e8ctrica i electr\u00f2nica","heb":"\u05d0\u05dc\u05e7\u05d8\u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4","ita":"Elettronica ed Elettrotecnica","fin":"Elektroniikka","tha":"\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01\u0e17\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e34\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e4c\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e1b\u0e01\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32","nld":"Elektronica en Elektrotechniek","chi":"\u96fb\u5b50\u8207\u96fb\u6a5f","eng":"Electronics_and_Electrical","dan":"Elektronik og elektro","jpn":"\u96fb\u6a5f\u30fb\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9","eus":"Elektronika","bul":"\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430","zho":"\u7535\u5668\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50","fas":"\u0627\u0644\u06a9\u062a\u0631\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u06a9 \u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0642","lit":"Elektronika","nor":"Elektronikk og elektroteknikk","hrv":"Elektronika i elektrika","rus":"\u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430","pol":"Elektronika i elektrotechnika","fra":"Electronique et \u00e9lectrique","bos":"Elektronika i elektrika","deu":"Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","srp":"Elektronika i elektrika","ces":"Elektronika a elektrotechnika","ukr":"\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0439 \u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0430","ell":"\u0397\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0397\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac","por":"Electr\u00f3nica e El\u00e9ctrica"},"description":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Electronics and Electrical\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; sector category includes industries and companies that manufacturer electronic and electrical components, equipment, and hardware, and manufacturers of materials, supplies, tools, components and equipment that are specific to the manufacture of electronics and electrical components. \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Sites for industries and companies that manufacture, distribute and sell finished electronics and electrical products (e.g. home appliances, radios, TVs, etc.) are not listed here. \u0026lt;P\u0026gt;Only a few companies in the world qualify to be listed on the main page.

An income stream can be any future payment including real estate notes, business accounts receivables, viaticals or senior settlements, structured settlements or prize winnings. Investors purchase all or part of an income stream from sellers at a discount rate. The seller receives immediate cash for an asset that may not mature for many months or years and the investor receives a good return on their investment over time. Often a seller will deal with a cash flow broker who has a network of contacts to find the appropriate investor for the seller's asset. Brokers offer expertise and experience with specific income streams and may save the seller the time and research required to find and select an investor. Brokers earn a commission on each transaction they close which is paid either directly by the investor or as a percentage of the funds to be received by the seller.","parent_uuid":"c3db906f-1b4f-4fb1-9b48-a84aeb5928bf","odp_last_updated":"2008-01-11T08:43:09-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":274650},{"uuid":"5fe11e31-4f8e-49d0-b453-b77185747226","title":"Annuities","translations":{"eng":"Annuities"},"description":"This category is for companies and brokers involved in the purchase of guaranteed income streams such as annuities, lottery winnings, casino winnings, structured settlements, and sports contracts.","parent_uuid":"7c02bdea-08d4-426a-ad57-353c780ad89b","odp_last_updated":"2008-04-19T06:32:11-05:00","related":["3fcb01d3-2637-4105-9cb2-e8b98274198f"],"odp_id":274658},{"uuid":"658a8ab6-c763-4d7a-8e24-00adbcc9309e","title":"Factoring","translations":{"tur":"Faktoring","eng":"Factoring","rus":"\u0424\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433","pol":"Faktoring","deu":"Factoring"},"description":"Factoring is the purchase of accounts receivables from a business for a fee.

The debtor uses the loan to pay off all of their outstanding debts and then just has to deal with making the one loan payment. 2) A debt consolidation service provider which will negotiate with a debtor's creditors and obtain the most favorable terms possible. The debtor makes a monthly payment to the service provider who then makes payments to the debtor's creditors in an agreed upon apportionment.

What is an actuary? Consider the following description from BeAnActuary.com: \"Actuaries put a price tag on future risks. They have been called financial architects and social mathematicians because their unique combination of analytical and business skills is helping to solve a growing variety of financial and social problems. Actuaries make financial sense of the future. How? An actuary applies mathematical models to problems of insurance and finance. To be more specific, actuaries improve financial decision making by developing models to evaluate the current financial implications of uncertain future events. If you\u0092ve never met an actuary, that\u0092s not unusual. The actuarial profession numbers only about 19,000 people in North America. But don't let that small number fool you. Actuaries put their special problem-solving skills to work in many different business situations, and their work has had an influence on people\u0092s lives for more than a century. Actuaries make a difference. Their calculations and projections are the backbone of the insurance and financial security industries. Actuarial work involves lots of math, but actuaries must also be up-to-date on business issues and trends, social science, law, and economics. In other words, actuaries have a well-rounded business approach to problem solving. And they must be good communicators to explain things to nonactuaries. Actuaries are key players on a company's management team. They are well paid, and they like what they do for a living.\"","parent_uuid":"43008fdd-893f-48a4-b50d-cabe4b9410eb","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:51:04-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":274573},{"uuid":"ce6b4841-74ac-43c6-b0fc-095e25e269cf","title":"Academic_Departments","translations":{"eng":"Academic_Departments"},"description":"Although actuarial science is closely identified with the business community, many universities offer actuarial science as an academic discipline.

Mortgage bankers serve as middlemen, arranging and making loans using short-term funding, and then selling these loans to other lenders and investors, both within the U.S. secondary market and abroad. The buyers of mortgages include private conduits, commercial banks, thrifts, life insurance companies, pension funds, and, most significantly, the secondary market agencies -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae -- through various securitization programs. Though some mortgage banking companies may be subsidiaries of depository institutions or their holding companies, mortgage companies themselves do not receive money from individual depositors. \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; Mortgage bankers are the primary suppliers of loans to the secondary market through programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase primarily conventional mortgage loans, while Ginnie Mae is involved with government loans exclusively. All three agencies were created with a mission to provide liquidity to the mortgage market and affordable housing to homebuyers and renters. They currently channel approximately two-thirds of total home mortgage credit and, working with their mortgage banker partners, they have reduced the interest rate cost of credit by as much as 1/2 percent, according to housing experts. \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; Mortgage bankers also make use of a number of federal and state government programs to provide more affordable housing credit. For example, the U.S. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides mortgage insurance for residential mortgages. Over the course of its over 60-year history, FHA has insured home loans for some 20 million Americans. The U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) administers the VA Home Loan Guaranty program which enables mortgage lenders to offer long-term, low-downpayment mortgage financing to eligible veterans. Mortgage bankers have long been the primary originators of FHA and VA loans. In addition, through a wide variety of state programs, mortgage bankers are the delivery vehicle for providing low interest rate financing to moderate-income homebuyers. \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; Mortgage bankers, in conjunction with their lending partners, serve a critical need in the United States. They make homeownership possible for tens of millions of Americans. They also help to build communities by providing financing for places where people can work and shop and play.

In turn, most of them concentrate on jobs that can be considered in terms of general rather than specialized machining. In other words, they produce parts by turning, milling, boring, and grinding metal, but they don't often go beyond these processes. Given this basis -- and recognizing the sheer volume of firms of so similar a nature -- it is considered useful, if only as a matter of convenience, to index Machine Shop sites under a series of subcategories based on location. Note: Shops that (regardless of what they may call themselves) concentrate on a particular type of machining as opposed to a variety of general operations are, relatively speaking at least, much less numerous -- and in consequence their customers are more widely scattered. Accordingly, sites of this kind are collected -- and retained -- under several appropriate headings such as Grinding, Spinning, and Stamping. In a few cases, too, shops focused on less common machining processes (as, for example, thread rolling and cold heading) are allocated to the main Machine_Shops category. Additional note: Tool and Die Shops differ from Machine Shops and have a category of their own. Their emphasis is on producing tooling, patterns, dies, fixtures, gages, and parts that involve one form or another of special or sophisticated machining.

The rationale for such allocations rests on a judgement (however arbitrary it may be) that coating processes add a finish with little if any change in the physical properties of the underlying surfaces, whereas plating almost always changes them. In turn, polishing depends to a large degree on a machining (or sometimes a hand) operation and belongs under a Plating heading only if it takes some form of electromechanical or electrochemical deposition or alteration to the surface.","parent_uuid":"904f2b84-a167-420e-8048-b3b42c8bda0a","odp_last_updated":"2009-04-14T14:05:57-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":277453},{"uuid":"59078740-fc41-4c4f-b0e6-322a9df9cfed","title":"Anodizing","translations":{"eng":"Anodizing"},"description":"This category covers sites related to anodizing, an electrochemical process primarily applied to provide aluminum surfaces and products with a variety of protective finishes and properties.

As far as possible, these differences are reflected in the allocation of sites to either this main category or those that recognize a predominant -- or even total -- focus on one given process rather than the others. Note: Many plating companies also offer (wet) painting and (dry) powder coating services and, provided neither process is the major part of the business, can be justifiably included in this main category or one of its subcategories. Where, however, either painting or coating is the overriding service, a site will -- and should -- be more appropriately listed in the Business/Industries/Manufacturing/Casting,_Molding,_Machining/Surface_Treating category. Additional note: Metal polishing is a further service that can be among a plating company's capabilities, but if this feature is the dominant one, the site more properly belongs in either the Polishing subcategory or the Bus/Ind/Mfg/CstMldgMchng/Surface_Treatment one -- with, once again, the recognizable business emphasis determining the particular allocation.","parent_uuid":"884897c2-3cb1-486f-ba0e-8d81db474e53","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:54:19-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":277463},{"uuid":"faae9e7b-ddff-44dc-92fc-93808087cafb","title":"Polishing,_Buffing_and_Grinding","translations":{"eng":"Polishing,_Buffing_and_Grinding"},"description":"This category covers the range of finishing obtained by such processes as grinding and buffing.

Note: It's perhaps a fine point, but the better allocation of many Polishing sites exists in the Surface_Treating category (see the \"Machined_Finishing\" link to it).

The category breaks the sites into groups that relate to either a main type of equipment or a particular field of industrial operation. Many of these groups are further broken down into subcategories that each assemble sites that have something in common with one another. An important point about all the sites is their focus on the equipment used in manufacturing an end product or achieving an end result. This is quite different from concern about the raw material involved in the manufacturing process. Sites of that sort belong in the relevant Resources industry categories. Note: Although over 5000 sites are distributed among the numerous subcategories that make up this Machinery and Tools section of the Open Directory, a relatively small percentage of them are indexed in five \"above the line\" categories: Associations, Directories, Employment, Technical Services, and Used Machinery. The focus in each case is on a general or all encompassing application to users of machinery and tools rather than on a narrower relationship to a specific industry or manufacturing process. Additional note: Several dozen sites are indexed, too, below the list of subcategories on this page. They represent companies that feature a diversified or out-of-the-ordinary range of products or services and are therefore difficult -- if not impossible -- to include elsewhere. A few of them do, at first glance, appear to have a relationship to a given subcategory, but the diversification of their interests and activities suggests that they are more justifiably listed under this \"catch-all\" heading.","parent_uuid":"7cadcec8-ac31-4a72-abeb-fede64134cbd","odp_last_updated":"2010-04-16T06:48:36-05:00","related":["bcb35cc3-0e88-43b1-a55a-4c0ed8d49e3d","904f2b84-a167-420e-8048-b3b42c8bda0a"],"odp_id":277504},{"uuid":"a16866ef-1e2d-4e81-a22e-e042e477d50b","title":"Assembly_Equipment","translations":{"eng":"Assembly_Equipment","deu":"Baugruppenfertigung"},"description":"This category focuses on companies involved in designing and supplying largely automated systems for assembling a variety of manufactured products.

Where auctions sites are involved, they also show the status of bids to date. Note: Despite the title of this category, it does -- and can -- include some manufacturer sites, especially where the product range doesn't readily fit elsewhere. As just one example, hand and power tools aimed at a wide variety of markets can belong here, particularly if they aren't appropriate for the Hydraulic and Pneumatic category. Additional note: The separate Used Machinery category also contains a list of possible sources for equipment of a general nature. However, where equipment is restricted to use by a specific industry or applies to a particular type of processing, a site is usually more appropriately indexed elsewhere -- as in the numerous listings to be found throughout the various subcategories that make up this Machinery and Tools section of the Open Directory.

Moreover, many companies serving the machining and fabrication industries offer a diverse range of products and often name them in a variety of different ways. However, if only for the sake of some consistency, the following assumptions form the basis of allocating sites in the numerous pages that make up this major category. 1. Tooling is considered to be items such as toolholders and workholders that add to the capabilities and capacity of cutting machines and machine tools. It also refers to add-on equipment that doesn't normally come with an original machine. Quite often it is described as a capital addition as opposed to a product that will wear out and eventually need replacing. (In what may be a useful analogy, a Tooling product can be seen as a computer peripheral.) 2. Tools are adjustable and reusable items that produce a desired result when fitted into a cutting or fabricating machine. The range covers saws, knives, and blades, as well a host of drill bits and inserts, grinding tools, cutting dies, and end mills. (Extending the computer analogy, Tools can be seen as printer ribbons and ink cartridges.) 3. Consumables are items such as lubricants that facilitate cutting, drilling, and machine operations in general, as well as media used with grinding, buffing, and polishing equipment. As the term implies, there's an ongoing use of the product during a machine operation. (A computer analogy isn't readily available, but printing paper and floppy discs are somewhat comparable examples.) Note: A number of sites are indexed in this main Tooling,_Tools,_Consumables category itself. The rationale for this allocation lies in the fact that the companies involved supply the full range -- or at least a diversified selection -- of these ancillary products. Additional note: This same \"catch-all\" principle applies to the three main subcategories (Accessories; Parts_and_Consumables; and Tools) -- i.e. the companies involved have a product or activity range that is varied rather than narrow in focus.","parent_uuid":"5ecf0937-a483-4323-82cb-5a671439ff41","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:54:25-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":277514},{"uuid":"60779c45-4188-48e0-a3d9-c820ed1b1f1e","title":"Accessories","translations":{"eng":"Accessories"},"description":"This category and its four subcategories are concerned with add-on products that facilitate the use of cutting and machining equipment.

This is the basis of some investors preferring certain, specific kinds of well managed closed end funds.

URL's containing an affiliate ID will not be accepted, however it is acceptable to list your own page, which in turn can have links to affiliate sites, provided that your pages add value to the viewer in the form of information, advice, hints, tips etc. that they would not be able to find on the affiliate site itself.","parent_uuid":"9d7855a6-d1cf-4670-bef6-03564844b427","odp_last_updated":"2008-04-08T22:36:07-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":281470},{"uuid":"98c5e106-6512-49d4-bec6-b36b5e648465","title":"Weblogs","translations":{"eng":"Weblogs","rus":"\u0411\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438"},"description":"Weblogs written by affiliate marketing leaders.","parent_uuid":"9d7855a6-d1cf-4670-bef6-03564844b427","odp_last_updated":"2010-06-10T07:27:22-05:00","related":["a241bd1b-5a57-4328-b3c3-a8225489315e"],"odp_id":281459},{"uuid":"a502be03-2e4c-4ecc-824d-d30dc8ca5879","title":"Partners_Programs","translations":{"eng":"Partners_Programs"},"description":"Associate, affiliate, and other private labeled or partner sales programs.","parent_uuid":"d0094c5e-b3ac-4304-8883-e5e7f196c2c8","odp_last_updated":"2009-11-29T21:45:46-05:00","related":["9d7855a6-d1cf-4670-bef6-03564844b427"],"odp_id":281456},{"uuid":"c6640144-1ca9-44ac-a237-dc7308a7e5c0","title":"Phone_Cards_-_Phone_Service_Reps","translations":{"eng":"Phone_Cards_-_Phone_Service_Reps"},"description":"Sites which offer opportunities for selling phone cards or telephone services.","parent_uuid":"d0094c5e-b3ac-4304-8883-e5e7f196c2c8","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:48:20-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":281410},{"uuid":"b88b6af7-ad5f-4120-bef6-87b5d81126f9","title":"Resources_and_Networking","translations":{"eng":"Resources_and_Networking"},"description":"Information and Resources to assist in networking, multi-level marketing and other business opportunities, either online or offline.","parent_uuid":"d0094c5e-b3ac-4304-8883-e5e7f196c2c8","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:48:20-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":281409},{"uuid":"6387611b-df73-4802-b635-95a380396a03","title":"Valuation_Services","translations":{"eng":"Valuation_Services"},"description":"Companies or services for analyzing and appraising the value of businesses, product lines, or intangible assets.","parent_uuid":"d0094c5e-b3ac-4304-8883-e5e7f196c2c8","odp_last_updated":"2007-09-28T03:09:34-05:00","related":["2d30d7a2-a44f-4b08-8018-ca117b82ad36","0d74865c-9655-49df-a049-b660dfb814ed"],"odp_id":281392},{"uuid":"db63ed04-e254-46f2-be0e-ce6f21c161a0","title":"Vending","translations":{"eng":"Vending","rus":"\u0412\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0433"},"description":"Sites describing opportunities for operating vending machines, resources for merchants, and information about the vending industry as a whole.

A good agent will also negotiate a satisfactory contract on your behalf, ensure that you're paid on time, and do a hundred and one other things that writers need doing.","parent_uuid":"7a8bb677-10d8-460a-a9f4-00b7ade600bf","odp_last_updated":"2007-08-31T07:57:01-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":277695},{"uuid":"01f0f857-f55d-4edc-aa2a-9752dd5fc95a","title":"Associations","translations":{"eng":"Associations"},"description":"These sites have information about literary agents including why you want an agent, how to get an agent, things to look for in an agent and what to avoid.","parent_uuid":"81f83e32-99a0-4fcf-8f2b-3ae8f7117c06","odp_last_updated":"2007-08-31T07:57:05-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":277698},{"uuid":"1cd7bfe1-2778-4e31-8768-4509c437b418","title":"Directories","translations":{"eng":"Directories"},"description":"Directories of literary agents","parent_uuid":"81f83e32-99a0-4fcf-8f2b-3ae8f7117c06","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:53:05-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":277696},{"uuid":"fff82868-2d23-47f8-a6ac-930feec38fcd","title":"Magazines","translations":{"tur":"Dergi","ita":"Periodici","nld":"Tijdschriften","eng":"Magazines","pol":"Czasopisma"},"description":"This category lists publishers of magazines and periodicals.

fibers are quickly becoming an important source of raw materials for the nonwovens industry. The obvious reason for that is the growing concern about the ecological dangers (real or imagined, I'm not going to get into that one), processing of chemicals is posing to the environment. But there are a number of other incentives for nonwovens manufacturers, to make use of renewable sources like plant and bast fibers. First of all because, with care and good management, they're always available. Sometimes it's just plain good economics. Products made from natural fibers are rapidly growing in popularity, despite the usually higher retail prices. I, for instance (if I am allowed a personal confession in the framework of this project), will not be caught dead in a polyester shirt. So, this is what this category will be about. Links to companies that make the fibers from weed, tree or plant, for other companies to make my shirts from them.","parent_uuid":"8302d883-55f3-4211-b557-fa8addcbb01d","odp_last_updated":"2010-06-03T05:46:25-05:00","related":["0887f8f5-b1bd-4232-934d-8e923b203052","c426fab6-6d41-42eb-920a-4db8f0f164dc"],"odp_id":282153},{"uuid":"5176ffe7-ac1d-417e-ae65-384a7778c928","title":"Bamboo","translations":{"eng":"Bamboo"},"description":"This

The reason for distribution being a separate from general business or enterprise resource management (ERP) is that the distributor occupies a distinct place in, what is called, the extended supply chain, that reaches from manufacturer to the end-customer. Some business trends attempt to remove the distributor from the supply chain (a process called disintermediation). A distributor's choice of business management software is critical in streamlining business processes, increasing profitability, reducing transaction costs, enhancing customer service, maximizing inventory investment, and remaining competitive and a valuable contributor in the supply chain.","parent_uuid":"bb8cf952-ade2-452b-b622-ed9bb7cebfeb","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:49:06-05:00","related":["d132a961-533c-46e1-9838-eec7245e2ff7"],"odp_id":275176},{"uuid":"cd248eb4-0805-40a1-a134-82ae9a0960d5","title":"Logistics","translations":{"nld":"Logistiek","eng":"Logistics","lit":"Logistika","rus":"\u041b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430","deu":"Logistik"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"f5dfecef-45d3-4207-9409-1bff92179d0e","odp_last_updated":"2007-06-06T15:54:53-05:00","related":["9cb0300b-614a-4af3-873c-6cc4086aa3d6"],"odp_id":275167},{"uuid":"a8f3e32f-e399-4f58-a491-faef9ad993b8","title":"Logistics_Information","translations":{"eng":"Logistics_Information"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"cd248eb4-0805-40a1-a134-82ae9a0960d5","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:49:07-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":275168},{"uuid":"ab059dba-2412-44c4-a483-878f0cc6fb85","title":"Reverse_Logistics","translations":{"eng":"Reverse_Logistics"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"cd248eb4-0805-40a1-a134-82ae9a0960d5","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:49:07-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":275170},{"uuid":"0cf42aa2-a1d2-466b-855c-1aaa6d78c30e","title":"Software","translations":{"swe":"Programvara","nld":"Software","eng":"Software","fra":"Transport et logistique","deu":"Informationstechnik"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"cd248eb4-0805-40a1-a134-82ae9a0960d5","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:49:07-05:00","related":["d132a961-533c-46e1-9838-eec7245e2ff7"],"odp_id":275172},{"uuid":"b16c69fb-ef50-42f9-b2e7-d734c28d6024","title":"Third_Party_Logistics","translations":{"swe":"Tredjepartslogistik","eng":"Third_Party_Logistics","deu":"Kontraktlogistik"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"cd248eb4-0805-40a1-a134-82ae9a0960d5","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:49:07-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":275171},{"uuid":"66729829-54fe-42f7-b4a7-5eb4d63d746f","title":"Warehousing_and_Storage","translations":{"nld":"Opslag","eng":"Warehousing_and_Storage","deu":"Lagerung"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"cd248eb4-0805-40a1-a134-82ae9a0960d5","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:49:07-05:00","related":["75a8ff02-f40b-4887-9572-0404dab166a8"],"odp_id":275169},{"uuid":"702750a6-1fb4-4e2d-9eed-6fbbec3cf420","title":"Education_and_Training","translations":{"nld":"Cursussen en Opleidingen","eng":"Education_and_Training","dan":"K\u00f8reskoler","jpn":"\u8cc7\u683c\u30fb\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb","fra":"Enseignement et formation","deu":"Aus- und Weiterbildung"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"21876438-2e4a-4329-958d-59871d164be3","odp_last_updated":"2010-05-30T09:32:29-05:00","related":["c258c3d1-c66a-4b13-89f9-fac0755ff659"],"odp_id":275511},{"uuid":"5adb8854-5dd3-44cc-b14e-d283f2810577","title":"Employment","translations":{"nld":"Banen","eng":"Employment","deu":"Besch\u00e4ftigung"},"description":"","parent_uuid":"21876438-2e4a-4329-958d-59871d164be3","odp_last_updated":"2007-01-02T17:49:30-05:00","related":["cfa139af-a9d5-4347-a095-068b946350a1"],"odp_id":275859},{"uuid":"f736b92d-39c0-4f6f-aadb-357f08e636c4","title":"Fleet_Maintenance","translations":{"eng":"Fleet_Maintenance","deu":"Fuhrparkverwaltung"},"description":"The Fleet_Maintenance Category is for companies that provide systems, specialized equipment, or other services that assist in maintaining a fleet of vehicles.","parent_uuid":"21876438-2e4a-4329-958d-59871d164be3","odp_last_updated":"2009-05-05T12:50:49-05:00","related":[],"odp_id":275850},{"uuid":"5b80735b-7362-4415-8a9b-ca5c1ce56670","title":"Freight_Forwarding","translations":{"swe":"Spedit\u00f6rer","ita":"Spedizioni","eng":"Freight_Forwarding","dan":"Spedition","jpn":"\u30d5\u30a9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30fbNVOCC","zho":"\u8fd0\u52a1\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406","deu":"Spedition"},"description":"Freight forwarders facilitate the movement of goods in international trade by playing an intermediary role between their clients and the companies who pick up, transport, and deliver goods to their destinations.
